# Momentum Tasks

_The first step is half the battle._

Momentum is a personal task tracker with user reporting, designed towards the user creating many frequent and small reports on their progress towards completion of a given task.

#### Why?

The concept behind Momentum is to make continuous reporting on the state of a task rewarding, and the hardest part of any task, is starting said task. That is why the first report you create on a task is worth 50%, no matter how many reports there may be on the task.
